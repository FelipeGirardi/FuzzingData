# FuzzingData
This repository contains data (in the form of charts, graphs, etc. created via Python/Matplotlib) that was obtained while running fuzzing campaigns in different fuzzers, with the aim of comparing the performance of these fuzzers.

To execute: in the plot_data folder, write on the terminal "python3 mean_and_median_graphs.py 5" to get both the mean and median graphs for both the edges found and the number of executions values with a time interval of 5 seconds per value. Change the argument number to increase or decrease the time interval value.
